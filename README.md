# Portfolio 1 (Web App Dev)

## To Run:

- clone the repo
- in the project's root terminal, run `~$ php -S localhost:8000`.
- run `index.html` with live server (supported in VS Code, not sure about visual studio).

My default database `all.db` has been included in this repo, you can delete it and start fresh if testing.
